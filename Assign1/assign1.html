    <h2>Hello, my name is Josiah</h2>
    <p>I'm in my thrid year of pursuing a Computer Science degree. As of today, I am have chosen the Applied option with a data science focus, but that is subject to change.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>"what is the most complex or interesting thing you've done with your current web development skills?"</h3></li>
        <p>When I was in middle school, a friend and I learned basic html and batch and would create games in windows notepad. 
            Obviously this is very crude and basic, but it was a lot of fun and my introduction to html</p>
        <li><h3>"what do you hope to learn from this class?"</h3></li>
        <p>I am looking forward to learning how to integrate CSS and javascript into html. 
            I knew the <em>very</em> bascis of html, quite a bit of javascript, and no css, so learning how to use them in tandem to build a webpage is exactly the skill I need to add to my toolset.</p>
        <li><h3>"have you signed up for our course Campuswire forum?"</h3></li>
        <p>Yes, of course! While you will be disappointed in the fact I won't be active enough to earn your extra credit, I plan to rely heavily on it as a resource for my learning.</p>
        <li><h3>"A description of the most interesting fact about you or the most unique experience you've had."</h3></li>
        <p>My cat, Apollo, provides me with endless entertainment. He is a snowshow siamese, meaning he is large, needy, energetic, and talkative. 
            My family has always had cats, and a lot of the people I know have cats, but Apollo is so weird. Sometimes, it is hard to beleive he is a cat! Here's a picture of Apollo and me:</p>
