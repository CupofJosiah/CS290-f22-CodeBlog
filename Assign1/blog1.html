            <h3>"What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment?  How did you work through them?"</h3>
            <p>An issue I had with this asssignment was getting started. While I have had previous experience with HTML, my experience was limited and nearly eight years ago.
                As a result the biggest challenge has been starting! The lecture that was given on Friday, as well as the Mozilla articles on HTML, has given me the refresher I needed to relearn HTML and recall the buried knowledge.

            <h3>"What did you learn from this assignment?  What did you already know?"</h3>
            <p>Liked mentioned earlier, I have been relearning a forgotten language. The part I remembered was how the tags works, the conecpt of the markup, and how the code translated to the page. 
                The part I forgot was what the markups were and what they meant exactly. I have really enjoyed relearning them and I'm excited to </p>

            <h3>"What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment?  How did you use these resources?"</h3>
            <p>The Mozilla articles, outisde of the lecture, were most helpful. They contianed the lists of tags with examples of best uses and syntax.</p>
