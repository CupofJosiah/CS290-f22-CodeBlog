    <h2>Blog Post 3 - Scripting Benny's List</h2>
    <div class="qna">
        <h3>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have.  How did you solve those problems?</h3>
        <p>The post filtering was definitely the hardest part of the assignment. Retrieving all of the correct information from the input fields was one challenge.
            Checking against the post filters was also challenging, but it made it harder when a field was left null. The hardest part of all was refiltering the data.
            All of the posts had to be stored into a permanent and separate array, and then reinserted into the DOM in the correct order.
            The code for all of these ended up somewhat simple, but they all had to be done in the most specific and careful ways that made it difficult to implement.
        </p>
        <h3>What did you learn from the assignment?  Were there any special insights you had?  What did you find that you already knew?</h3>
        <p>I am already familiar with javascript, but not for web development, so the interactions with the HTML DOM was a good learning experience.
            One insight I had, was how the HTML objects, despite acting like other data structures in javascript like arrays,
            they could only sometimes be treated like arrays.
        </p>
        <h3>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment?  Specific websites?  Lectures?  The class Piazza forum?  The TAs?  How did you use each of these resources?</h3>
        <p>When I initially started the assignment, we had not finished the JavaScript manipulation of the HTMl DOM unit.
            While I had figured out how to show and hide the modal, I was very confused on how I was going to use JS to work on the rest of the assignment.
            As we completed each lecture, however, there would be a specific demo that would showcase exactly the outcomes I was envisioning in my mind.
            An example is from when I was stumped on how to retrieve an array of the posts so that a loop could be made to search them for filtering.
            The next lecture discussed getElementsByClass() and posts.children[]. By far, the lectures were most helpful.
        </p>
        <h3>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h3>
        <p>I Google a lot while coding; almost any time I get stuck I Google my problem.
            One thing I had to Google was how truthy/falsy worked <em>exactly</em> so that I could craft my filters to ignore blank input fields in the fewest lines.
            Another thing I had to Google was how to replace '&lt;' and '&gt;' characters as text values to avoid cross-site script injections.
            There were many more things, but those are a few examples.
