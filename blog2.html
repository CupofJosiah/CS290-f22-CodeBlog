            <h3>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have.  How did you solve those problems?</h3>
            <p>I had some major issues with this assignment. I've never really worked with CSS before, but it felt very intuitive.
                Even still, there are a lot of features and ways to style the CSS, so when looking to try to style an element in a specific way, I did not have any knowledge of styles to pull from.
                One specific example of an issue I had that caused me a lot of grief was with the filter box. I could not get the input box on the same line as the text label.
                After consulting a bunch of online resources, I finally figured out how to use flexboxes to put the two elements on the same AND space them apart equally.
            </p>
            <h3>What did you learn from the assignment?  Were there any special insights you had?  What did you find that you already knew?</h3>
            <p>I learned a lot from this assignment. Having known nothing about CSS before this class, this assignment was ideal for me to understand CSS.
                Being able to have a goal to get to with only basic to guide me is exactly what I needed to be able to test and play with the many features available in CSS.
                Without this assignment I wouldn't understand flexboxes at all, nor how to play with padding and margins to get the look <em>just</em> right.
            </p>
            <h3>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment?  Specific websites?  Lectures?  The class Piazza forum?  The TAs?  How did you use each of these resources?</h3>
            <p>I did need to rewatch the flexbox CSS lecture in order to fully understand flexboxes.
                Having that recorded resource available to me to view again was the only way I was able to properly format the filter box and the posts.
                Campuswire likely could have been a nice resource, but it is unorganized and structured to linearly for me to consume.
                Forum threads are typically most helpful for me, as I can quickly find a post similar to my issue and then digest the responses.
                I did find the w3s documentation very helpful, especially when I needed information about specific properties.
            </p>
            <h3>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h3>
            <p>A skill that I picked up as a beginner coder on my high school robotics team was very precise googling.
                I essentially googled every problem I couldn't solve by rewatching the lectures.
                For example, when I was attempting to style the add post button, I was having issues making it a circle. So I google "making circle button css".
                It worked, I don't remember what forum I found, but someone had a walkthrough of styling the shape of a round button with CSS.
