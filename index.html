    <h2>Blog Post 4 - Node.js</h2>
    <div class="qna">
        <h3>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have.  How did you solve those problems?</h3>
        <p>I could not understand response protocol for the life of me. 
            I felt silly once I understood, but I had to review my resources many times before understanding.</p>
        <h3>What did you learn from the assignment?  Were there any special insights you had?  What did you find that you already knew?</h3>
        <p>I have tried to work with servers before, but I did not understand enough to actually learn anything that time around.
            This time also started out with no understanding. 
            I honestly had no specific moments of insight, rather would continue debugging until it would finally work.
            After it worked, I would break the code on purpose to figure out why it worked.
            I suppose that could count towards a specific insight, but it was mostly me breaking down the problem until I understood it.
        </p>
        <h3>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment?  Specific websites?  Lectures?  The class Piazza forum?  The TAs?  How did you use each of these resources?</h3>
        <p>I rewatched the lecture twice.
            I also would rewind and skip forward.
            Without the lecture and the lecture notes, I would not even have a starting point.
        </p>
        <h3>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h3>
        <p>I Googled a lot this time around, just like I do for most all code projects, but it was not any help this time.
            I most likely wasn't searching for the correct keywords, but I could not find the answers I was needing.
            For example, I needed help with writing images to the response. 
            Google simply kept referring me to the http documentation for every question I had.
            Finally, I figured out to stop converting all of the files to utf8, and the image was served just fine.
            The only help I got from Google, was when I was confused why my server was taking so long to respond, it referred me to an old stack overflow thread.
            The solution was that I forgot to write out respond.end()!
